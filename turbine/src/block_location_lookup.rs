//! Lookup from a repair nonce to the location where this shred should be stored
//! When requesting repair we insert the (Nonce, Location) pair here.
//! Once the shred passes sigverify checks, the Location is fetched before insertion into blockstore.
//!
//! This lookup avoids having to pass the location information around, or polluting
//! the OutstandingRequests cache with this extra information and lock contention.
//!
//! We don't actively cleanup this cache, its size is managed according to Lru policy
